```php
$file = fopen("test.txt", "r+");
if ($file) {
    // ... process the file ...
    fclose($file); // Close the file
}
```
This code has a potential issue: if `fopen()` fails (e.g., the file doesn't exist or is not readable), `$file` will be `false`.  The code proceeds to use `$file` without checking if it's `false`.  This will lead to a fatal error (or at least unexpected behavior) when `fclose` is called on a non-resource (false).

The subtle bug here lies in assuming `fopen()` always succeeds.  Error handling is crucial for robust PHP code.
